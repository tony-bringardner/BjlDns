# BjlDns
 The DNS project provides everything you need to run a DNS server and  a DNS client
 and a NsLookup tool.

The intent of this DNS code is to support a large number of domains with very little administrative overhead.
 
 this is one of the eldest packages in the library adn I think it's due for an upgrade...
 
# Major Features:
 +  Supports unique configuration for any domain.
 +  Supports a common configuration that will be used for any domain that does not have a unique configuration.
 +  Domains may be in a database or file system
 +  Support Dynamic DNS (DDNS) with trivial configuration
   
 
Dependencies:  
+ BjlCore  
+ BjlIo
