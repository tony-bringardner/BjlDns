# BjlDns
 The DNS project provides everything you need to run a DNS server and  a DNS client
 and a NsLookup tool.

The intent of this DNS code was to support a large number of domains with very little administrative overhead.
 
# Major Features:
 +  Supports unique configuration for any domain.
 +  Supports a common configuration that will be used for any domain that does not have a unique configuration.
 +  Domains may be in a database or file system
 +  Support Dynamic DNS (DDNS) with trivial configuration
   
 
Dependencies:  
+ BjlCore
